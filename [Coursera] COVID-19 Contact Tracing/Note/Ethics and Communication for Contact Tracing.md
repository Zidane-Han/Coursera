### Question Types and When to Use Them

- **Closed** -- used to limit answer choices

- **Open** -- used to generate descriptive answers that require more than one word

- **Probing** -- used as a *follow-up* question to get more information about a person's response (e.g. "can you tell me more?")
- **Checking** -- used to confirm that you heard correctly
- **Leading** -- used to guide people into believing they should answer in a certain way

### Active Listening

- Why?
  - tells the case/contact that you are hearing them
  - creates space for them to tell you more; encourages them to provide important details
  - develops a relationship that may be important for future check-ins that you may have with them

- How?
  - Paraphrasing -- repeating what was just said to you but using your own words
  - Reflecting -- putting words to the emotions being expressed to you
  - Silence -- being totally quiet (or offering small words like "uh-huh") so the other person can finish talking or work out a thought

- Whatï¼Ÿ
  - Observations: without judgement, noticing what is happening for them and for you
  - Feelings: what emotions are being expressed, felt and communicated by them and you
  - Needs: requirements for living a good life
  - Requests: what you are wanting from the other person or what they are wanting from you
