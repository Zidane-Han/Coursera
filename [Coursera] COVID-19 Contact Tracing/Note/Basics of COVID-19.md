# Basics of COVID-19

### Facts of SARS-CoV-2 Virus

- **Coronaviruses** (CoVs) are a large group of viruses. Some regularly cause mild respiratory illness in people.

- SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
- Special coronaviruses have jumped species and can be transmitted between people.
- Three coronaviruses since 2002: SARS (emerged in Guangdong in 2002); MERS (emerged in the Middle East in 2012); SARS-CoV-2 (emerged in Wuhan in 2019)
- SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes the illness we call **COVID-19** (short for "coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019")

### Signs and Symptoms of COVID-19

- **Signs** are *objective measurements* to characterize illness during a physical exam. (temperature, breathing faster...) 
- **Symptoms** are what patients say about *how they feel*. (fatigue, nausea, loss of taste or smell, muscle ache) 
- Common signs and symptoms: fever, tiredness, chills, muscle pain, cough, loss of taste or smell, difficulty breathing, headache, sore throat ...
- Some people have no symptoms and are **asymptomatic**.
- Many symptoms (such as fever, cough and myalgia) are **nonspecific**, they are common in COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. Some symptoms are more **specific** for COVID-19, like loss of the ability to taste or smell.
- The most common signs of progressive infection are increased and more severe fevers and increased difficulty breathing. Patients should **immediately** seek care if they have emergency warning signs or symptoms, such as:
  - Blue lips or face, which could mean they are not getting enough oxygen
  - Increased rate of breathing
  - Shortness of breath
  - Chest pain when breathing
  - Waking up during sleep with shortness of breath
  - New confusion or difficulty waking up

### Timeline of Infection

- The **incubation period** is the time from when someone is infected until symptoms develop.
- The SARS-CoV-2 incubation period ranges from **2 to 14 days**. 50% of people will become ill by 5 days after they are infected; 95% of people will become ill by 14 days.
- The **infectious period** is the time during which someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 can transmit the virus to other people.
- The infectious period begins 2 days *before* the start of signs and symptoms of disease.
- The end of the infectious period is defined as when (>= 10 days after the onset of illness && symptoms are improving && no fever within the past 3 days).
- The patients are most infectious at Day 1 of symptoms and contagion lessens with time.
- People who are asymptomatic can also be infectious.

### Risk Factors

- Old age (>65 year old)
- Obesity
- Existing medical conditions include:
  - Diabetes
  - Hypertension (high blood pressure)
  - Any kind of lung/heart/liver/kidney disease
  - Weakened immune system (note that a person who has HIV that is controlled with medication is not at substantially increased risk)

### Treatment of COVID-19

- How the disease can kill people?
  - If the lungs cannot recover, patients cannot breathe on their own.
  - Lack of oxygen can damage the organs in the body, causing increased risk for heart attacks, kidney failure, strokes, and clotting disorders.

- There is no specific treatment to cure COVID-19.
- Treatment is to support the body's functions until the body's immune system can fight the infection.
- Many patients with lung disease require mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. People who need it will receive support to keep their lungs working so that the body can continue to get the oxygen it needs.

### Diagnose of COVID-19

- **Diagnostic tests** identify virus in the body. These are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, also called molecular tests. These tests give a sign that the virus is reproducing in your cells.
  - The PCR test detects the RNA of the virus.
  - A positive PCR test shows that there are virus particles in the sample and means there is active infection.
  - False negative results: not all people with infection will have RNA in their sample.
  - How? Swab is taken from nose, throat or mouth. Specimen typically comes from somewhere in the respiratory tract. Saliva can also be tested.
- **Antibody tests** identify antibodies to the virus, usually in blood. Antibodies are made by immune system to fight off viruses or bacteria. Some antibodies (lgG) begin to develop when you are sick and can be identified after you recover.
  - lgG antibody is the most common antibody test.
  - The body starts to produce lgG antibodies 10 to 14 days after infection.
  - Antibody tests are usually performed on blood.
  - A positive lgG antibody test shows that you were infected with the virus *in the past*. It does not tell you when you were infected.

### Transmission of SARS-CoV-2

- **Droplet.** Infected people have the virus in their mouths, noses and throats. Droplets come out when we are talking, laughing, coughing and sneezing. Those droplets can enter another person's mouth, nose or eyes.
- **Surface.** Surfaces may have viruses from someone's respiratory droplets. Virus can survice on surfaces and then contaminate the hands of others.
- Transmission is more likely with closer contact. (physical contact and shared spaces)
  - Physical contact
  - Close contact (within 6 feet for 15 mins or more)
  - Shared environment
  - Sharing food and bathrooms
  - Sharing beds
  - Congregate housing (e.g. prisons, group homes, dormitories, shelters)

### Reproductive Number (R0 or R-Naught)

- Def: the number of people that one infectious person will infect if everyone that person has contact with is susceptible to the disease.
- It is a good way to measure how fast a disease can spread. The higher the reproductive number, the more people will be infected.
