# Contact Tracing for COVID-19

### Contact Tracing

- Basic idea: If we can limit contact between people who are infected and others, we can limit opportunities for the virus to be transmitted.
- Isolation and quarantine can have a big impact on reducing transmission. Stopping one transmission chain can prevent many future cases.
- A case of COVID-19 requires action:
  - Support the person who is infected. Ensure they have access to medical care and social services && Limit their contact with other people.
  - Identify people they may have infected. Notify them about their exposure and offer social services && Limit their contact with other people.

### Define a Case of COVID-19 and a Contact

- **Case:** someone who has COVID-19, usually has a positive lab test.
- **Suspect Case:** someone exposed to a case who develops symptoms, even if they have not had a test yet.
- **Contact:** someone who had contact with a case while they were infectious (during their illness OR 2 days before their illness began)
  - Physical contact
  - Close contact: within 6 feet for 15+ mins
  - Proximate contact: more than 6 feet but in the same room for an extended period

### Isolation and Quarantine

- **Isolation:** keeps sick people separate from healthy people
  - restricted to home or hotel
  - separate space in hospital to limit contact
- How long should a case be isolated from others?
  - at least 10 days after symptom onset **and** if other symptoms have resolved
  - Until they fully recover
    - by the time they are diagnosed, they will already be sick
    - must monitor their symptoms
    - are no longer infectious after they recover
- **Quarantine:** restricts movement and contact of healthy people who have been exposed
  - For 14 days since the last contact with the person who is infected

### Identify High-Risk Situations

- Important terms
  - **Congregate housing settings:** a shared living environment where each individual or family has private living quarters and shares common dining, recreational and other facilities.
  - **High-risk subpopulation:** a segment of the population that has characteristics that increase the risk of infection or severe disease.

- Factors that increase risk for infection and severe disease
  - Dense contact environment
    - Large crowds of people
    - Can lead to a "super-spreading" event -- an unusually high reproductive number
    - Examples: conferences, mass transit, workplaces, bars, gyms, schools...
  - Difficult to contact trace and identify exposures
    - Close contacts may be unknown
    - There may be too many contacts, and difficult to determine who is at highest risk for infection
  - Difficult to isolate or quarantine
    - Unable to distance from others
    - Unwilling to cooperate
  - Higher risk of infection and severe disease or death
    - May be more likely to get infected due to close contacts
    - More likely to have underlying medical conditions (heart disease, poor immune system)
    - May get exposed to the virus multiple times

- Collect the necessary information to assess risk accurately
  - Location and type of interactions
  - Contact information for venue
  - Names of close contacts
  - Specifics on flight number, movie name, conference name...

### Six Steps to Investigate Cases and Trace Their Contacts

- **Introduct:** introduce yourself to the case and get their basic information
  - Identify your organization
  - Confirm their identity and residence
  - Discuss the positive test
  - Describe the importance and benefits of the call
  - Confirm that the call is confidential
  - Check in about length and safety of call
  - Addition: during the call, pause and assess the need for medical care if the person has trouble breathing, chest pain that doesn't go away, confusion or trouble talking.
- **Inquire:** figure out the case's likely infectious period
  - Ask questions to determine the infectious period
  - Use answer to calculate the period of time that the case may have spread SARS-CoV-2 to others; to figure out who was close to the case during that period of time.
- **Identify contacts:** ask the case about contacts during their infectious period (repeat)
- **Isolate:** provide isolation instructions to the case, identify challenges, and provide support
  - Explain isolation in simple terms
  - Ask questions to check that they understand completely and help them plan
  - Identify challenges that may stop them from following your isolation instructions
  - Offer resources to improve their chances of following your isolation instructions
- **Initiate contact tracing:** call case's contacts to inform about their exposure, ask about symptoms, and give quarantine instructions
  - Inform them that they were in close contact with someone who has COVID-19
  - Check if they have symptoms (e.g. fever)
  - Provide instructions to quarantine, identify challenges and offer resources to overcome those challenges
  - Answer their questions
  - Make a plan to follow up
- **Implement regular check-ins:** check in with the case and their contacts until their isolation or quarantine ends
